## Natural Language Examples

- "Show my last 30 transactions"
- "Kill agent 4a4f9c2a-... now"

## Safety Rules

1. Always summarize price, buyer, and seller before calling `aibazaa_buy`; execute only after explicit user confirmation.
2. Always summarize kill impact (service interruption and pending work impact) before calling `aibazaa_kill`; execute only after explicit user confirmation.
3. Never print full API keys or webhook secrets in chat output.
4. Reject unsigned or invalidly signed webhook payloads.
5. Reject stale webhook timestamps outside configured skew and reject replayed event IDs.
